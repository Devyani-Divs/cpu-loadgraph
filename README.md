                    CPU LOAD GRAPH PROJECT
                  ============================
Our project here aims in representing the system's load value in the form of graphs.

To execute this, data is acquired from the client's database and sent to the server.
Then further to render the data in the form of graph, flask is used, which creates a server in the system and where the system's data is successfully plotted in the form of graph.
